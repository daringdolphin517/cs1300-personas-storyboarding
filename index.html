<h1>CVS Self-Checkout: <br> Is It Really Worth It?</h1>

    <h2>What is Self-Checkout?</h2>
    <div class="row text-center">
        <div class="col my-auto">

            <p> 
                By using self-checkout, CVS hopes to streamline the checkout process, allowing users to quickly and 
                efficiently scan their own merchandise and leave the store without having to wait in line for an attendant to manually scan their items. 
                Users scan their items' barcodes on the bottom of the machine, use the large screen to select their method of payment, 
                and finally use the small screen to input a credit or debit card (if applicable).

                In this image, you can see what CVS would call an <b>"Easy 3-Step Process"</b>, but is it really that easy?

    <h2>The Interview</h2>
    <p><em>3 CVS customers were observed and interviewed regarding their experiences with self-checkout.</em></p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">
            <h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                <li class="list-group-item">How would you describe your self-checkout experience?</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Why did you choose self-checkout over traditional checkout?</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Was the system intuitive?</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Did you run into any problems?</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Would you use self-checkout again?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
            <h3>Some Key Observations:</h3>
            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                <li class="list-group-item">Some users know exactly what buttons to push immediately, making the process as fast as possible and ignoring any extra features. Others struggle to figure out which buttons to push at all.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Some customers left after payment, but without pushing the “Would you like a receipt” button, leaving the machine mid-transaction for the next user.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Many customers opted to use self-checkout over traditional checkout even when there was no line for traditional checkout.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
            <h3>Some Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered text-left">
                <li class="list-group-item">The CVS self-checkout experience was generally uneventful.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">If you know what you're doing, you can check out in a flash. If you don't, it's difficult to ascertain which buttons to press, where to put your merchandise, etc.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">While hypothetically faster than traditional checkout, there are a lot of areas where the process can go wrong, and waiting for an attendant to come fix the machine for you ruins the efficiency of the experience.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Despite the difficulties, <b>all interviewed users would use the self-checkout again.</b></li>

    <h2>The Two Primary User Personas</h2>

        <div class="col-sm">
            <img src="images/anxious_annie.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Persona of Anxious Annie">
            <figcaption>Anxious Annie only needs to buy a pack of NyQuil, so she attempts to use the self-checkout for the first time.</figcaption>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Because she is a first time user, the overwhelming number of possibilities for which buttons to push and when leaves her very confused. Even after figuring out how to scan her one item, the machine forces her to wait for an attendant, and she takes a long time to finish her checkout process, angering the customers behind her.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">For first-time users, the CVS self-checkout machines can be daunting. There are simply too many components and not enough clear directions on how to use the machine.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
            <img src="images/efficient_evan.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Persona of Efficient Evan">
            <figcaption>Efficient Evan desperately needs to do his laundry and has run out of detergent. He wants to quickly do his laundry while he still has time today, so he can only spare 5 minutes at CVS.</figcaption>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Efficient Evan has used the checkout machine many times before, and he knows exactly what to expect before using it. Because of this, he is able to quickly scan and pay for his items without any surprises. The only problem these users face stems from the time spent waiting for their turn to use the machine, while the line is clogged with first-time users.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">For frequent users, the CVS checkout machines streamline and speed up the checkout process. Assuming the machine is available, checkout can be performed much faster than with a cashier, greatly improving the customer’s overall experience.</li>
